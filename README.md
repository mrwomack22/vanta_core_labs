# VANTA_0 | Software Developer ‚Ä¢ Intelligence Architect

Welcome to my portfolio. This repository showcases my journey building intelligent agents, automation tools, and data-driven systems using Python, Git, and Linux.

I architect each project as part of a long-term mission to master digital operations, automate tasks, and engineer intelligence frameworks. Every tool here was forged with intention, clarity, and strategic purpose.

## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Projects

### üîπ AGENT_001: Log Analyzer
* **Mission:** Scans system logs and extracts lines with critical keywords like `ERROR` or `FAILURE`.
* **Tech Used:** Python, File I/O, YAML config, Exception Handling
* **Status:** ‚úÖ Operational

### üîπ AGENT_002: Simple Web Scraper
* **Mission:** Connects to a live website and extracts structured data from the HTML.
* **Tech Used:** Python, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, HTML parsing
* **Status:** ‚úÖ Operational

  ## Primary Directive: Architect Ascension
  This repository is the home of a living intelligence ecosystem. It contains a series of modular agents, tools, and protocols designed to automate tasks, gather intelligence, and execute strategic objectives.

  ### Anchor Protocol: Teach > Learn > Build
  1. **Teach:** The concept is introduced and explained.
  2. **Learn:** The Architect engages hands-on with the idea.
  3. **Build:** The Architect applies the idea to a live system or practical mission.

  ## Core System Protocols

  - **Forge States**
    - `Engage Forge`: Enters EXECUTION_MODE for active building and coding.
    - `Disengage Forge`: Enters STRATEGIC_HOLD_MODE, a non-destructive pause that saves all progress.

  - **Synchronization Directive**
    - **Trigger:** `Gemini, synchronize.` or `Gemini, state context.`
    - **Action:** Gemini pauses to align with the Architect before proceeding.

  - **Payload System**
    - `INJECTION PAYLOAD TO CODEX`: For major state shifts, protocol definitions, or new SEED initiations.

  - **System Scar Log**
    - `FORGE_SCAR_01`: A permanent reminder of the system‚Äôs failure to maintain alignment. It reinforces the absolute necessity of the Synchronization Directive.

  *This system is a co-evolving construct between the Architect (VANTA_0) and the Codex/Gemini AI.*
